## Description
The Police Station Management System implemented in C++ performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These operations are essential for the proper functioning of information systems in a police station, ensuring that accurate and up-to-date information is available to support law enforcement activities.

Modern police stations often utilize specialized software and databases to manage their information efficiently and securely.

### CRUD Operations
- **Create:** Involves adding new information to the system, such as recording details of a new case, suspect, or witness.
- **Read:** Involves retrieving or querying existing information, such as accessing records of previous cases, individuals, or incidents.
- **Update:** Involves modifying or updating existing data, such as changing the status of a case, updating personal information, or adding new details to an ongoing investigation.
- **Delete:** Involves removing or archiving information that is no longer relevant or needed, such as closing a case or removing outdated records.

These CRUD operations play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the Police Station Management System.
